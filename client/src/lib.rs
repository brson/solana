//! Network clients of Solana nodes.
//!
//! A Solana cluster is composed of Solana nodes, some of which participate as
//! validators. Other programs interact with the network as clients of those
//! nodes.
//!
//! The main types of clients are _RPC clients_, and _pubsub clients_, which
//! query, transact with, and receive events from Solana nodes via the [Solana
//! JSON RPC API][JSON-RPC].
//!
//! [JSON-RPC]: https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api
//!
//! Clients can be either blocking or nonblocking, in which case they are
//! written in asyncronous Rust, on top of the [tokio] runtime. The nonblocking
//! clients are generally located under the [`nonblocking`] module.
//!
//! [tokio]: https://docs.rs/tokio
//!
//! ## Solana client types
//!
//! **RPC clients** are for sending queries and transactions to a Solana node.
//! The blocking type is [`rpc_client::RpcClient`]. The nonblocking type is
//! [`nonblocking::rpc_client::RpcClient`].
//!
//! **Pubsub clients** are for receiving event notifications from a Solana node,
//! and can be more efficient than querying with an RPC client. The blocking
//! type is [`pubsub_client::PubsubClient`]. The nonblocking type is
//! [`nonblocking::pubsub_client::PubsubClient`].
//!
//! **TPU clients** communicate directly with the [TPU] of the [slot leader] to
//! fill blocks with transactions as fast as possible. Validators are TPU
//! clients of each other. Most users do not need to use TPU clients, though
//! tools that need to submit many transactions may want to communicate directly
//! with the TPU. An example of a tool that communicates directly with the TPU
//! is `solana program deploy`, which posts many transactions to deploy a single
//! program. Of the multiple TPU clients the [`quic_client`] is recommended.
//!
//! [TPU]: https://docs.solana.com/validator/tpu
//! [slot leader]: https://docs.solana.com/cluster/leader-rotation
//!
//! ## Client crates
//!
//! For historical reasons this `solana-client` crate is a fa√ßade that reexports
//! every client type from other crates. Instead of using this crate
//! users may want to use crates specific to their purpose:
//!
//! - [`solana-rpc-client`] - The RPC client.
//! - [`solana-pubsub-client`] - The Pubsub client.
//! - [`solana-quic-client`] - The QUIC TPU client.
//! - [`solana-udp-client`] - The UDP TPU client.
//! - [`solana-tpu-client`] - The legacy TPU client.
//!
